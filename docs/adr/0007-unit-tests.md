# 7. Unit tests

Date: 2019-02-15

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to make a decision on the testing framework for our project.

## Decision

We will make use of pytest. It is a de facto standard in the Python community
and has unrivaled power.

## Consequences

There is a learning curve to pytest if you have never used it before.
